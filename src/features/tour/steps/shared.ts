/**
 * Shared Step Fragments
 *
 * 📍 src/features/tour/steps/shared.ts
 *
 * Steps reused verbatim across multiple tour keys, so content only lives
 * in one place. Base steps are the persona-agnostic sidebar items visible
 * to (almost) everyone (§5.1 of docs/features/tour.md) — role/company
 * exclusions for them are handled by `useTour`'s `useFilteredNav`-backed
 * visibility filter (nav item hidden for this user -> step silently
 * dropped), not by `requiresRole` here.
